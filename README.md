# StartNG-Project
My first GitHub repository for StartNG
## StartNG-about
Start NG is a pre-internship program to the HNG internship. It is organized mostly for beginners into the world of programming and technology. It serves to help youths actualize their goals by providing the necessary tools, resources and mentors to guide them through their first baby steps into the programming world. This repository contains the projects; files tasks or links given to the interns to meter our progress. Here is a link to learn more about StartNg and its sponsors: https://alexandrasheadspace.home.blog/2019/08/25/a-guardian-called-flutterwave/ 
## Getting Started:
To access the files, just click open the repository above, for now based on the file currently in the repository,  all you need to view is a browser. No other plug in is needed. 
## Installation or prerequisite:
No prior installation needed, the file currently in the repository is easily accessible by a working browser, so for now (till the next task) there is no prerequisite for accessibility. 
## Package:
The file currently within the repository is my CV in html format. It's was a little challenging to get something close to my satisfction and no css or js was used (compulsory part of the task) .
## Contributing:
Pull requests are welcome. For changes like other ways to spice up the file (in html only) or write the code, please open an issue first to discuss the added input so I can learn from it. Thanks in advance
